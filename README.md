# ArchLinux_config

Some of my own Arch Linux config files, include some applications' config files. For the i3's configuration & beautification, I have made modifications based on [ayamir's i3-dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ayamir/i3-dotfiles) that apply to my own habits, thanks to [ayamir](https://github.com/ayamir)!
